    adding 2 numbers together (a + b)
    substracting 2 numbers together (a - b)
    multiplicating 2 numbers together (a * b)(a x b)
    dividing 2 numbers together (a / b)
    exponents of "a" to the power of "b" (a ^ b)
    factorials (a !)
    roots (a r b) with "a" being the root degree and "b" the radicand
    base "a" logarithm of "b" (a log b)
    natural logarithm of "a" (a ln)
